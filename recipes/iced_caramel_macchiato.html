    <h2>About This Recipe</h2>

    <p>We all have had this staple Starbucks classic at least once in our lives (and if you haven't then you are <em>certainly missing out!!</em>)</p>  
    <p>This Iced Caramel Macchiato recipe features a vanilla flavored espresso drink with cold milk, ice, and caramel drizzle. The only part of the drink that’s caramel is actually just the drizzle on top.</p>
    <p>What’s unique about this drink is how it’s made with the vanilla syrup and milk on the bottom, then shots of espresso sitting on top of the milk and ice, and finally, a drizzle of caramel. For a drink to be an Iced Caramel Macchiato, the milk has to be at the bottom, and the espresso on the top.</p>
    <p>The ingredients for this recipe are slightly out of the ordinary and likely not a common item in your pantry. That being said, I have included a link within the text of some of the unique ingredients below to help you understand what we're using in this recipe.</p>
    <p>So without further ado, let's get started on this refreshing caffeinated delight! Good luck, have fun, and <em>enjoy!</em></p>
