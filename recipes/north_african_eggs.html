    <h2>About This Recipe</h2>

    <p>Nothing quite says <strong>brunch</strong> or <strong>breakfast</strong> like this recipe for North African Eggs.</p>
    <p>The aroma in your home left behind from this recipe will have your neighbors knocking at your door asking what smells so delicious in your kitchen!</p>
    <p>This recipe is quick, easy, healthy, and most importantly, <em>delicious!</em></p>
    <p>The end result of this recipe turns out to be savory, dense with flavor, and <em>packed</em> with the best of what these vegetables have to offer.</p>
    <p>The sprinkle of fresh green onion at the end is the sleeper here for sure. Once I made this dish without it (I forgot) and I instantly felt that the texture and flavor it provided was dearly missed so don't forget it!</p>
    <p>I personally have never been able to find the fresh coriander leaves where I live. Sometimes I simply dash a few shakes of ground coriander or grind some seeds myself and sprinkle it, but if you skip that step then this recipe still turns out delicious so do not worry if you do not find that ingredient.</p>
    <p>One last thing! This recipe is from an episode of one of Gordon Ramsay's instructional cooking shows.  Ever heard of him? I'm sure you have! A link to him recreating this beautiful delight can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nmAFmoTLZw" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1 onion, peeled and diced</li>
        <li>1 red pepper, deseeded and diced</li>
        <li>1 green pepper, deseeded and diced</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>1 red chilli, deseeded and chopped (use some seeds if you like heat)(I use a serrano pepper when I cannot find the red chilli)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>5 ripe tomatoes, roughly chopped (add a pinch of sugar if the tomatoes aren't quite ripe)</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp chopped coriander leaves (to serve) (optional)</li>
        <li>1 spring onion, trimmed and finely chopped</li>
        <li>Crusty bread (to serve)</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat a heavy-based frying pan over a medium heat. Add a dash of oil and sweat the onion for 5 minutes until soft. Add the peppers and continue to sweat for 5 minutes, then add the garlic and chilli and fry for 1–2 minutes until soft and tender.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the cumin and fry for 1 minute, then add the tomatoes, season and cook for 15–20 minutes until the tomatoes have completely collapsed (add 3–4 tablespoons of water to the mixture if the tomatoes aren’t that moist). The mixture should be the consistency of a thick sauce. Stir to mix well, taste and adjust the seasoning.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Make 4 wells in the tomato mixture and break an egg into each well. Cover the pan and cook gently over a medium-low heat for 5–6 minutes, or until the egg white is set and the yolk is still a little runny.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve sprinkled with coriander leaves and chopped spring onion, plus plenty of crusty bread on the side to mop up any juices.</li>
        <br>  
        <li>Enjoy!!</li>
    </ol>
